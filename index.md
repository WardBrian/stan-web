## StanCon 2023

[StanCon 2023](/events/stancon2023/) June 20-21, at the Washington University in St. Louis was a great success.

Slides and materials from the talks and presentations are available at https://github.com/stan-dev/stancon2023

We thank our sponsors for their generosity, all of the speakers for sharing their expertise,
the StanCon organizing committee and the local organizers for many, many hours of hard work,
and the WUSTL staff for their hospitality.
Many, many thanks to all of the participants for making this a rewarding experience!


## About Stan
Stan is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling
and high-performance statistical computation.  Thousands of users rely
on Stan for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction in
the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and
business.

Users specify log density functions in Stan's probabilistic
programming language and get:

* full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling <span
class="note">(NUTS, HMC)</span>

* approximate Bayesian inference with variational inference <span
class="note">(ADVI)</span>

* penalized maximum likelihood estimation with optimization <span
class="note">(L-BFGS)</span>

Stan's math library provides differentiable probability functions
&amp; linear algebra <span class="note">(C++ autodiff)</span>.
Additional R packages provide expression-based linear modeling,
posterior visualization, and leave-one-out cross-validation.

## Get Started

Stan interfaces with the most popular data analysis languages <span
class="note">(R, Python, shell, MATLAB, Julia, Stata)</span> and runs
on all major platforms <span class="note">(Linux, Mac,
Windows)</span>. To get started using Stan begin with the 
[Installation](/users/interfaces) and [Documentation](/users/documentation/) pages.
