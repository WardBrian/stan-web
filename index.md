## Announcing StanCon 2023

Registration is open for [StanCon 2023](/events/stancon2023/), an **all-in-person** conference being held at the Washington University in St. Louis!


## About Stan
Stan is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling
and high-performance statistical computation.  Thousands of users rely
on Stan for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction in
the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and
business.

Users specify log density functions in Stan's probabilistic
programming language and get:

* full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling <span
class="note">(NUTS, HMC)</span>

* approximate Bayesian inference with variational inference <span
class="note">(ADVI)</span>

* penalized maximum likelihood estimation with optimization <span
class="note">(L-BFGS)</span>

Stan's math library provides differentiable probability functions
&amp; linear algebra <span class="note">(C++ autodiff)</span>.
Additional R packages provide expression-based linear modeling,
posterior visualization, and leave-one-out cross-validation.

## Get Started

Stan interfaces with the most popular data analysis languages <span
class="note">(R, Python, shell, MATLAB, Julia, Stata)</span> and runs
on all major platforms <span class="note">(Linux, Mac,
Windows)</span>. To get started using Stan begin with the 
[Installation](/users/interfaces) and [Documentation](/users/documentation/) pages.

## Citing Stan

We appreciate citations for the Stan software because it lets us find out what 
people have been doing with Stan and motivate further grant funding. See 
[How to Cite Stan](/users/citations/) for more details.

## Open Code &amp; Reproducible Science

Stan is freedom-respecting, open-source software <span
class="note">(new BSD core, some interfaces GPLv3)</span>.&nbsp; Stan
is associated with NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit supporting open code
and reproducible science, through which you can [help support
Stan](/support/).
