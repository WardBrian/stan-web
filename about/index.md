# Stan Governing Body (SGB)

The scope of the SGBâ€™s authority is all things Stan. That includes
ownership/management of trademarks, online resources like Discourse
and GitHub and membership in the Stan community. The SGB has authority
over:

* ownership and management of trademarks
* online resources including the Stan Discourse, the stan-dev GitHub
  organization
* NumFOCUS funds
* fundraising in support of Stan
* authorizing and/or running Stan conferences
* licensing requirements for contributed code and documentation

The SGB is intended to be a transparent body in service of the Stan
community and electorate. To this end the SGB will post regular updates 
about its activities on the [Stan forums](http://discourse.mc-stan.org) 
in the [Stan Governance category](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/c/stan-governance/41).

The SGB is to advance diversity in under-represented communities in
the Stan ecosystem. The SGB will actively develop and implement
strategies to improve inclusion and diversity at all levels of the
Stan project and will prepare an annual diversity report.

To reach the current SGB with any questions, concerns, or feedback,
please email <board@mc-stan.org>.
