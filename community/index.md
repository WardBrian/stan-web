# Stan Forums

If you're looking for help with installing Stan, coding and debugging Stan
programs, Bayesian inference in general, or just want to let everyone know
what you're doing with Stan then please post to the Stan Forums,

* <p><a href="http://discourse.mc-stan.org/">Stan Forums</a>
<span class="note">(Discourse)</span></p>

Everyone who joins the forum has posting privileges.  We love hearing about
applications of Stan and we try very hard to be as helpful as possible, so
please don't be shy to introduce yourself, share your work, or ask a question!

There are also discussions happening over on Slack. Anyone is welcome to join at
[mc-stan.slack.com](https://mc-stan.slack.com/). **Update:** As we are reaching maximum capacity of the slack workspace, we are trying out a move to Zulip. Anyone is welcome to join via [this link.](https://mc-stan.zulipchat.com/join/irkoc4dfqkppddwpni2iomr7/){:target="_blank"}
