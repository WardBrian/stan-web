**Call for proposals**

We're now accepting proposals for contributed talks and tutorials. Proposals are reviewed by the organization committee on a rolling basis.

Contributed talks are 15 minutes long, with an additional 5 minutes for questions. Talks can cover a diversity of topics, including:
* Data analysis and modeling using Stan in any field
* Software development within Stan or the Stan ecosystem, and more broadly software relevant to Stan users
* Methodological development for Bayesian modeling

To submit a proposal for a talk, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecIfstHZUqdGEyQEaeMNW9gwuM97ofD3iWmFPJnoe11iHEvw/viewform). 

Tutorials are either half-a-day or one day long, with each half-day 2 or 3 hours long. Tutorials should be introductory, though certain pre-requisites may be assumed (e.g. basic knowledge of Stan, R, Python, probability, etc.). When submitting a proposal be specific about the pre-requisites.

We will provide an "introduction to Stan" tutorial, aimed at participants who have not used Stan before.

To submit a proposal for a tutorial, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTJJDpSFArDcrdyD8Hrd_ImnUvYLvmHGc-Ci6Om3AJx5ryzg/viewform).
